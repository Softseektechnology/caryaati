        answer: "You will need to bring your driving license with you to pick up your hire car. Car hire companies expect drivers to have held their full license for at least two years. Provisional licenses and Copy version aren't accepted. When you hire a car abroad in some countries you will need an International Driving Permit (IDP), as well as your own driving license. If you have a UK driving license, you may be asked for a code at the car hire counter. Please visit the DVLA* website (https://www.gov.uk/view-driving-licence) before your trip. <strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> You will find more specific driving license requirements in Terms and Conditions of each car during the booking process. If you still have any questions, please feel free to contact us."
